# v20 Ada Library User Manual

## Introduction

v20 is a Ada library for Linux service and console programs, primary designed to be used in Genesix, a cluster manager for High Availability virtual instances on GNU/Linux Debian/Xen servers. 

However, v20 is a general purpose library, KISS1 oriented and very efficient to create any command line program. AIDE uses v20 too.

v20 is also a modular library with components designed to work together. Naming and conventions are consistent. Currently, v20 is composed of ten packages in charge of unbounded strings, program and OS functions, console and text files, network, SQLite handling, logging and configuration files handling.

At least five other packages are planned, related to databases and web APIs, without being limited to these aspects only.
